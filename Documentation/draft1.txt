	Demands for smaller and more accurate robots, compact design is cheap, reliable and accurate, created to reduce bot footprint while maintaing same effectiveness, goal of this project is to create a small, accurate and high torque gearbox for NEMA series motors, to be used in robotics applications,

	Aim was to design and develop a high reduction ratio gearbox complimentry to NEMA series stepper motors. main use case of such gearbox being, in 6DOF robotic arm, where high torque is required in a compact space. Usually done through harmonic drives, belts, and gearboxes. Aformentioned gearbox works upon the same gearbox branch. Current gearbox designed has a reduction ratio of 70.5:1 and with a net torque of 0.15Nm in total volume of 0.000175m^3 (80m diameter and 35mm height).
