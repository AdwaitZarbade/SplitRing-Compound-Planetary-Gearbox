# Split-Ring Compound Planetary Gearsets

TL;DR - A 3D printed gearbox for NEMA17 stepper motor. High torque and Small volume.

Project is still a WIP as I try to find perfect size and gear ratio to be able to fit into my main project, 6DOF Robotic Arm.

Aim was to design and develop a high reduction ratio gearbox from scratch. Compatible with NEMA series stepper motors. Main use case of such gearbox being, in 6DOF robotic arm, where high torque is required in a compact space. Usually done through harmonic drives, belts, and gearboxes. Aformentioned gearbox works upon the same gearbox branch. Current gearbox designed has a reduction ratio of 70.5:1 and with a net torque of 0.15Nm in total volume of 0.000175m^3 (80mm diameter and 35mm height).

*  Purly for fun:
    I also conceptualized a 831.11:1 reduction gearset, with volume of just 0.00002827m^3 (40mm diameter and 22.5mm height). Volume of 16% of my final version.

Any vaulable feedback and contributions are always welcome!
